# Musa3D
Project for the course "Mobile development" of prof. Mascetti. Utilize the Augmented Reality to add virtual objects to real-world statues using iOS and ARKit.
Pointing the device camera at a scanned 3D real object allows to open a small media player to view the virtual object added, with an audio or text description.
